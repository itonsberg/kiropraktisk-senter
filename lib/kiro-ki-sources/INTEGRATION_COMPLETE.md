### Technical Implementation

**File:** `lib/knowledge-base.json`

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "title": "Article Title",
  "content": "Research-backed content (3000 chars max)",
  "url": "/forskning/article-slug",
  "metadata": {
    "symptoms": ["keywords", "related", "symptoms"],
    "sources": [
      {
        "title": "Source citation",
        "url": "source-url",
        "credibility": 80
      }
    ],
    "evidence_level": "high",
    "research_date": "2025-01-15"
  }
}
```

### Kiro KI RAG System

**How It Works:**
1. Patient sends question
2. RAG searches knowledge base (25 entries)
3. Finds top 2 most relevant sources
4. Provides context to AI
5. AI generates evidence-based response

**Keyword Matching:**
- Norwegian: rygg, nakke, skulder, kne, ankel, fot, hÃ¥ndledd, albue, kjeve, hodepine
- Symptoms: smerter, vondt, plager, myalgi, muskelsmerter, stiv, spenning
- English: back pain, neck pain, headache, shoulder pain, etc.

**Scoring System:**
- Keyword match: +10 points
- Symptom match: +5 points
- Top 2 highest scoring articles returned
- Max 800 characters per article

### Data Sources

**Current Sources:**
1. `lib/knowledge-base.json` (25 entries)
   - 15 treatment guides
   - 10 research articles

2. Mahana Engine (future updates)
   - Pipeline can be re-run for new topics
   - Auto-imports latest research
   - Maintains credibility scores

### Maintenance & Updates

**Weekly:**
Run import script to check for new articles:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/import-mahana-research.ts
```

**Monthly:**

```bash
cd /Users/botega/kiropraktisksenter.no/mahana-engine
npm run pipeline -- --topic "topic name"
```

**Quarterly:**
Full knowledge base refresh with latest clinical guidelines

### Quality Metrics

**Evidence Levels:**
- High: Academic papers, clinical trials (10 articles)
- Medium: Professional guidelines (5 entries)
- Standard: Treatment descriptions (10 entries)

**Credibility Scores:**
- 90-100: Peer-reviewed research
- 80-89: Clinical studies
- 70-79: Professional sources
- 60-69: General medical content

**Content Coverage:**
